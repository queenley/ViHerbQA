# Overview
ViHerbQA is a question-answering model developed for Vietnamese Traditional Herbal Medicine (VTHM). It uses a dataset of over 208,000 question-answer pairs generated by large language models. Built on the ViT5 model, it undergoes pre-training for open-book QA and fine-tuning for close-book QA to provide accurate answers in the VTHM domain.
The dataset, created from 745 herbal articles, covers various herbal knowledge, including chemical compositions and traditional treatments. ViHerbQA outperforms other Vietnamese QA systems, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in traditional medicine.
